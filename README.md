# TASK -3 E-COMMERCE-PRODUCT-PAGE-DESIGN - DESCRIPTION :

As part of Task-3 in my design workflow project, I was assigned to create an innovative product page for an e-commerce platform, incorporating advanced features such as 360° product views and customer reviews. The objective was to not only design a visually appealing interface but also create an interactive and functional experience for users browsing a 
product — in this case, footwear — through a mobile-first e-commerce app.

To begin with, I launched Figma and selected the iPhone 16 Pro Max frame as the base for all my screen designs. This helped me maintain consistency across various screen sizes and ensured my UI elements were well-optimized for modern devices. I structured the entire project as a working prototype that covers the complete shopping experience: from browsing the homepage, viewing specific brand models, interacting with product pages, searching via a dedicated search bar, logging in, and finally completing a purchase with a success screen.

*The design was built using a wide array of Figma tools and techniques. I used* :

 -> Shapes (rectangle, ellipse, etc.) for UI sections and button creation

 -> Text tools for product descriptions, pricing, headings, and customer reviews

 -> Auto Layout to keep all elements consistently aligned and responsive

 -> Frame nesting to create organized groups and maintain a clean design structure

One of the most helpful features during this process was Auto Layout. I used it extensively to align buttons, price tags, icons, and reviews consistently within frames.
Auto Layout made spacing and alignment across different sections (like size selector, “Add to Cart” button, and product image sliders) much more manageable. It also helped make the prototype more scalable — for instance, if I updated the text or icons, everything stayed aligned without manual repositioning.

For icons such as search, arrows, settings, and cart, I used a great open-source icon website called Lucide.dev. This platform allowed me to copy icons in SVG format and paste them directly into Figma, saving a lot of time and giving me access to a wide variety of lightweight, consistent icon styles that perfectly matched the minimalist aesthetic I was going for.

To enhance productivity and maintain a modular design approach, I also created Component Sets for UI elements that were reused across multiple pages. This included buttons, headers, input fields, rating stars, navigation bars, and image placeholders. Componentization ensured consistency and made updates very efficient — for example, 
if I modified the appearance of a button, it automatically updated across every instance in the design.

The 360° product view section was simulated by arranging multiple images of the footwear from different angles, placed inside a horizontally scrollable frame.
This gave the impression of rotating the shoe when the user drags or swipes across the images. Though native 360° animation isn’t directly supported in Figma, 
this simulated approach delivered a strong visual experience.

Customer reviews were placed in a dedicated section below the product, with user profile icons, star ratings, and short review texts displayed using text and avatar components. 
I also used Auto Layout here to dynamically expand each review block based on the content length.

I carefully mapped the entire user journey, starting from the homepage (with featured products and categories), through to the product detail page, a brand-specific listing,
the search bar interaction, login/sign-up pages, cart interface, and finally the “Payment Successful” confirmation screen. All these screens were connected using interactive prototypes, allowing users to navigate between screens and simulate a real app flow.

*Key Features & Tools Used* :

 -> Frame: iPhone 16 Pro Max for consistency

 -> Tools: Shapes, Text, Auto Layout, Grouping, Components

 -> Icons: Imported from Lucide.dev as SVGs

 -> Component Sets: Created for repeated UI elements like buttons, nav bars, etc.

 -> Simulated 360° View: Through image scroll interaction

 -> Customer Reviews: Displayed with avatars, ratings, and feedback text

 -> Prototype Flow: Connected from homepage to success screen

This task significantly strengthened my understanding of UI/UX best practices, prototyping in Figma, and the importance of consistency, alignment, and reusability in design systems.
It gave me hands-on experience in building a complete e-commerce experience while exploring realistic interaction patterns like product previews and customer feedback. 
Most importantly, I was able to replicate a real-world shopping experience in a clear, structured, and interactive design environment using Figma’s powerful tools.
